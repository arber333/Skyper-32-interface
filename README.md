# Skyper-32-interface
This is an interface board developed for use with Huebner inverter drive.
Rev 1 has some errors on it, but it functions perfectly with my inverter.  Fault pin does not get the signal however so PWM is not stopped on driver fault. Drivers do stop in case of errors, just master board doesnt know about it.

Rev 2 should have pads for larger gate resistors and some errors resolved. It is in design phase and not tested as of yet.
